This is a training dataset of 210 images used in the paper:

M. Andriluka, S. Roth, B. Schiele. People-Tracking-by-Detection and
People-Detection-by-Tracking. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and
Pattern Recognition (CVPR'08), Anchorage, USA, June 2008.

The dataset consists of 210 images of sideview pedestrians for which
positions of the person, their body parts and segmentation is
provided.

Segmentation for each pedestrian is provided in the directory "maps"
in the form of black/white images. 

The file "train-210.idl" contains list of the images along with
annotation rectangle for each person. Each line in the file contains
name of the image followed by the list of annotation rectangles in the
[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] format.

The file "train-210-annopoints.al" contains additional annotations for
body-parts of each person. The data is stored in a simple XML
format. For each annotation rectangle we store 11 annopoints which
mark locations of feet, lower legs, upper legs, torso and head
of the person.
